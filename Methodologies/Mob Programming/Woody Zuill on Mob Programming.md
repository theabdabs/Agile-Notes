# Woody Zuill on Mob Programming

Gather together people with all the needed skills and knowledge.
- Completely different. All together.

More than 1 keyboard. More than 1 computer, so people can research while coding.

In the example of his team. 1 telephone for the whole team, so they work together as a TEAM.

A video of his team working mob programming
- In his team (example) in 2012 they spent the first hour as a learning session regarding a question made the day before  that they didn't feel it was appropriate to review it while they were in the middle of their work.
- The driver switches every 15 minutes
- The PO spend as much time as they can with the team.
- You're allowed to go work alone anytime you want to
- You're in control of yourself (go for a walk, take a nap, etc)
- They had dinner together in the same room.
- After lunch they walked and didn't talk about their work. Fun time together.

Why would we work this way?
	Knowledge sharing
	Continuous code and design review
	Higher quality
	Rapid feedback
	Many perspectives on the work
	Better solutions
	Work on the right things
	Flow of work items (x10 things done in his team)
	More fun, less stressful, more engageing, etc.

It's NOT 5 people watching 1 person coding
	Example, basketball team. The goal is to pass the ball to someone that has a good chance to shoot to basket, not to shoot.

Pair Programming
	Driver/Navigator. Like a car where the passenger has the map. But he doesn't tell the driver to stop on red lights as he already know.
	Usually derives in Driver/Observer. Someone takes the keyboard and says "I know how to do that", then if you ask why he says "I'll tell you later". He's focused on the code, but the important part is the human brain part.
	=> For an idea to go from someone's head into the computer it must go through tsomeone elses's hands.
