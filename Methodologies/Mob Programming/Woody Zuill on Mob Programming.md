# Woody Zuill on Mob Programming

Gather together people with all the needed skills and knowledge.
- Completely different. All together.

More than 1 keyboard. More than 1 computer, so people can research while coding.

In the example of his team. 1 telephone for the whole team, so they work together as a TEAM.

A video of his team working mob programming
- In his team (example) in 2012 they spent the first hour as a learning session regarding a question made the day before  that they didn't feel it was appropriate to review it while they were in the middle of their work.
- The driver switches every 15 minutes
- The PO spend as much time as they can with the team.
- You're allowed to go work alone anytime you want to
- You're in control of yourself (go for a walk, take a nap, etc)
- They had dinner together in the same room.
- After lunch they walked and didn't talk about their work. Fun time together.

Why would we work this way?
- Knowledge sharing
- Continuous code and design review
- Higher quality
- Rapid feedback
- Many perspectives on the work
- Better solutions
- Work on the right things
- Flow of work items (x10 things done in his team)
- More fun, less stressful, more engageing, etc.

It's NOT 5 people watching 1 person coding
- Example, basketball team. The goal is to pass the ball to someone that has a good chance to shoot to basket, not to shoot.

Pair Programming
- Driver/Navigator. Like a car where the passenger has the map. But he doesn't tell the driver to stop on red lights as he already know.
- Usually derives in Driver/Observer. Someone takes the keyboard and says "I know how to do that", then if you ask why he says "I'll tell you later". He's focused on the code, but the important part is the human brain part.
	=> For an idea to go from someone's head into the computer it must go through tsomeone elses's hands.

the navigators are always thinking about where we're going and usually there is a navigator only one person navigating at a time. You never want two people speaking at the same time.

Work together: we let someone else finish their sentence before we break in

He started with rotations every 15 minutes. He prefers 4 to 7 minutes. As everyone is thinking because they will be required shortly.

Everybody is allowed to talk at anytime with only 2 rules:
- No talk when someone else is speaking
- No divert off the topic that someone else is talking about. If you want to divert, instead of we may try this and start coding you might say, when we're done with this I want to see if we can try something else

We can get rid of a lot of disruption and disagreement by simply agree to try everybody's ideas. Usually once you've tryed a couple of them usually a better idea shows up.

It is not enough of discussing an idea, you have to try it. If 2 ideas are discussed the team can be stuck in the discussion. Try an idea and learn from it. A better idea may show up. It is courtesy to try someone else's idea, even if you think it will never work. An NEVER tell I told you that it wasn't going to work.

> **Teamwork isn't something you get from a team, teamwork is something you bring to a team. It's your willingness to be a good team member.**

Driver: Smart Input Operator
- Liberates the team to focus on the right staff (The Problem, Solutions, Design, not the coe)
- Helps the team remain in flow
- Caution: Can easily block flow (by saying something like i don't think that's going to work

Navigators
- Working together in the Same Context
- Sharing the Cognitive Load
- Dialog: Talking, **Listening**
- Visible thinking with whiteboards, flip charts, sticky notes, index cards
- Sharing and integrating ideas (it's the continuous integration of ideas, no need to wait until late to show which idea was correct)
- Contribute the right thing
  - at the right time
  - in the right way


Q: Should we try an idea even if the whole team is against it (minus the one that proposes)?
A: If we don't consider equally all of the ideas we're missing the value in the future. It might look like we're wasting time but we're not in the long run

Q: How to avoid navigators thinking that their idea is the good one and start thinking in the team idea
A: There are a thousand right ways to do anything, so stop thinking yours is the one right away. And the first one you find it's the best one. You'll figure it out later if it is the right one but for right now that's what moves you forward.The first one you find use it and then if you feel you need a better one then that's the time to investigate it. Because we will spend a lot of time looking for the perfect right way and will never come upon it.
