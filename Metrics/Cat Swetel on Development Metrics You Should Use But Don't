You need to know when you start and when you finish

## Time in Process
Metric on Responsiveness
Units of time per unit of work
Shown in scatter plot: y axis Time in Process, x axis Date Delivered
90% and average lines

Shown in distribution: y axis frequency, x axis Time in process (in buckets, 1-5, 6 - 10, etc)

Thorughput (Units of work per unit of time)
Blocks in the scatterplot


Another metric
y axis number of times
x axis number of work items delivered in a given time (weeks?)
so 6 is 85% (85% of the times we deliver 6 work items or more)
11 is 50% (50% of the times we deliver 11 work items or more)

Per state (column in Kanban board)
Flow efficiency. With per state metrics to show where is the waiting time.


## How stable our system is?
Net between arrival and departure date. In this month we started 25 thing and we finished 30.
Do not make the bars red and green.


## Cumulative flow
* Average arrival rate (pendiente de fuera)
* Average departure rate (slope of inner line -done-)
* Average work in process (difference between the bottom line and the top line)
* Average time in process (difference horizontal)
Never provide a prediction based on this (they are averages)
=> Little's law
* Average # of items in a system = Average arrival rate * Average time spent in the system
* Average time spent in a system = Average # of items in a system / Average throughput

You need to take the statistics and write a story (give context). Example: we deliver 85% of the items in less than 55 days but provided that we are now finishing more things than starting it could be even less.
Provide numbers in context.
